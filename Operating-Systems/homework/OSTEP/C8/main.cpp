// 1. Run a few randomly-generated problems with just two jobs and
// two queues; compute the MLFQ execution trace for each. Make
// your life easier by limiting the length of each job and turning off
// I/Os.
//
// 2. How would you run the scheduler to reproduce each of the exam-
// ples in the chapter?
//
// 3. How would you configure the scheduler parameters to behave just
// like a round-robin scheduler?
//
// 4. Craft a workload with two jobs and scheduler parameters so that
// one job takes advantage of the older Rules 4a and 4b (turned on
// with the -S flag) to game the scheduler and obtain 99% of the CPU
// over a particular time interval.
//
// 5. Given a system with a quantum length of 10 ms in its highest queue,
// how often would you have to boost jobs back to the highest priority
// level (with the -B flag) in order to guarantee that a single long-
// running (and potentially-starving) job gets at least 5% of the CPU?
