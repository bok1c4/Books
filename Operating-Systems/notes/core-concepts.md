## Registers

### What are CPU registers?

**Registers** are super-fast memory locations built directly into the CPU. They store data that the CPU needs to access quickly during the computation.
We should think of them as of CPU's 'scratchpad' for performing calculations and managing execution.

### Types of Registers

**General Purpose Registers (GPR's)**

- Used to hold temporary data, variables or intermediate results of computations.
- Examples of GPR (in x86 architecture): **eax**, **ebx**, **ecx**, **edx**

**Special Purpose Registers**

- Instruction Pointer (IP) / Program Counter (PC): Holds the memory of the next instruction to execute
