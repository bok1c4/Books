Approach to learning:

50-10 rule: Read for 50 minutes, take 10 minute break.

**Focused Iterative learning** involves focusing on a topic until you've made progress, then iterating back to review or deepen that understanding after learning another related subject. Itâ€™s like layering concepts, with each cycle enriching the others.

1. Take a concept
2. Read a book
3. While reading build some projects
4. Do that for a month to month and a half
5. Switch to different topic
6. Comeback again

When concept is taken the one whole book should be read, and at least 2 projects implemented in that specific concept.
